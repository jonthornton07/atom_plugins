Just install mr.igor in your system\n(pip install mr.igor), and then install this package in atom.\n\nWhenever you save a python file, mr.igor will save all imports, so that you can\nremember them in any other python file just pushing `ctrl-alt-i`\n\nThe idea of this package came after having used mr.igor through Martin Aspeli's\n[SublimeTextIgorPlugin](https://github.com/optilude/SublimeTextIgorPlugin) for\nSublimeText 2 and Timo Stollenwerk's [MrIgor](https://github.com/tisto/MrIgor/)\nfor SublimeText 3.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/erral/python-mrigor/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/erral/python-mrigor","_id":"python-mrigor@2.1.3","_shasum":"dc4880c7df0b32da254db75ad1aa70dd27102c9d","_resolved":"file:../d-116118-38346-122bcl3/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116118-38346-122bcl3/package.tgz"}
